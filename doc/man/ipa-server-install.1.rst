ipa-server-install(1) -- Configure an IPA server
================================================

SYNOPSIS
========

ipa-server-install [*OPTION*]...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Configures the services needed by an IPA server. This includes setting
up a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and a Kadmin daemon with an
LDAP back-end, configuring Apache, configuring NTP and optionally
configuring and starting an LDAP-backed DNS server. By default a
dogtag-based CA will be configured to issue server certificates.

OPTIONS
=======

BASIC OPTIONS
-------------

.. option:: -r <REALM_NAME>, --realm=<REALM_NAME>

   The Kerberos realm name for the new IPA deployment.

   It is strongly recommended to **use an upper-cased name of the
   primary DNS domain name** of your IPA deployment. You will not be
   able to establish trust with Active Directory unless the realm name
   is the upper-cased domain name.

   The realm name cannot be changed after the installation.

.. option:: -n <DOMAIN_NAME>, --domain=<DOMAIN_NAME>

   The primary DNS domain of the IPA deployment, e.g. example.com. This
   DNS domain should contain the SRV records generated by the IPA server
   installer. The specified DNS domain must not contain DNS records of
   any other LDAP or Kerberos based management system (like Active
   Directory or MIT Kerberos).

   It is strongly recommended to **use a lower-cased name of the IPA
   Kerberos realm name.**

   The primary DNS domain name cannot be changed after the installation.

.. option:: -p <DM_PASSWORD>, --ds-password=<DM_PASSWORD>

   The password to be used by the Directory Server for the Directory
   Manager user.

.. option:: -a <ADMIN_PASSWORD>, --admin-password=<ADMIN_PASSWORD>

   The password for the IPA admin user.

.. option:: --mkhomedir

   Create home directories for users on their first login.

.. option:: --hostname=<HOST_NAME>

   The fully-qualified DNS name of this server.

.. option:: --ip-address=<IP_ADDRESS>

   The IP address of this server. If this address does not match the
   address the host resolves to and --setup-dns is not selected, the
   installation will fail. If the server hostname is not resolvable, a
   record for the hostname and IP_ADDRESS is added to /etc/hosts. This
   option can be used multiple times to specify more IP addresses of the
   server (e.g. multihomed and/or dualstacked server).

Configure chronyd to use this NTP server. This option can be used multiple times and it is used to specify exactly one time server.
.. option:: --ntp-server=<NTP_SERVER>

   Configure chronyd to use this NTP server. This option can be used
   multiple times and it is used to specify exactly one time server.

.. option:: --ntp-pool=<NTP_SERVER_POOL>

   Configure chronyd to use this NTP server pool. This option is meant
   to be pool of multiple servers resolved as one host name. This pool's
   servers may vary but pool address will be still same and chrony will
   choose only one server from this pool.

.. option:: -N, --no-ntp

   Do not configure NTP client (chronyd).

.. option:: --idstart=<IDSTART>

   The starting user and group id number (default random).

.. option:: --idmax=<IDMAX>

   The maximum user and group id number (default: idstart+199999). If
   set to zero, the default value will be used.

.. option:: --no-hbac-allow

   Don't install allow_all HBAC rule. This rule lets any user from any
   host access any service on any other host. It is expected that users
   will remove this rule before moving to production.

.. option:: --ignore-topology-disconnect

   Ignore errors reported when IPA server uninstall would lead to
   disconnected topology.

.. option:: --ignore-last-of-role

   Ignore errors reported when IPA server uninstall would lead to
   removal of last CA/DNS server or DNSSec master.

.. option:: --no-ui-redirect

   Do not automatically redirect to the Web UI.

.. option:: --ssh-trust-dns

   Configure OpenSSH client to trust DNS SSHFP records.

.. option:: --no-ssh

   Do not configure OpenSSH client.

.. option:: --no-sshd

   Do not configure OpenSSH server.

.. option:: -d, --debug

   Enable debug logging when more verbose output is needed.

.. option:: -U, --unattended

   An unattended installation that will never prompt for user input.

.. option:: --dirsrv-config-file

   The path to LDIF file that will be used to modify configuration of
   dse.ldif during installation of the directory server instance.

CERTIFICATE SYSTEM OPTIONS
--------------------------

.. option:: --external-ca

   Generate a CSR for the IPA CA certificate to be signed by an external
   CA.

.. option:: --external-ca-type=<TYPE>

   Type of the external CA. Possible values are "generic", "ms-cs".
   Default value is "generic". Use "ms-cs" to include the template name
   required by Microsoft Certificate Services (MS CS) in the generated
   CSR (see ``**--external-ca-profile**`` for full details).

.. option:: --external-ca-profile=<PROFILE_SPEC>

   Specify the certificate profile or template to use at the external
   CA.

When ``**--external-ca-type**`` is "ms-cs" the following specifiers may be
used:

   **<oid>:<majorVersion>[:<minorVersion>]**
      Specify a certificate template by OID and major version,
      optionally also specifying minor version.

   **<name>**
      Specify a certificate template by name. The name cannot contain
      any *:* characters and cannot be an OID (otherwise the OID-based
      template specifier syntax takes precedence).

   **default**
      If no template is specified, the template name "SubCA" is used.

.. option:: --external-cert-file=<FILE>

   File containing the IPA CA certificate and the external CA
   certificate chain. The file is accepted in PEM and DER certificate
   and PKCS#7 certificate chain formats. This option may be used
   multiple times.

   does not support the default signing algorithm.

SECRET MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
-------------------------

.. option:: --setup-kra

   Install and configure a KRA on this server.

DNS OPTIONS
-----------

IPA provides an integrated DNS server which can be used to simplify IPA
deployment. If you decide to use it, IPA will automatically maintain SRV
and other service records when you change your topology.

The DNS component in FreeIPA is optional and you may choose to manage
all your DNS records manually on another third party DNS server. IPA DNS
is not a general-purpose DNS server. If you need advanced features like
DNS views, do not deploy IPA DNS.

.. option:: --setup-dns

   Configure an integrated DNS server, create DNS zone specified by
   --domain, and fill it with service records necessary for IPA
   deployment. In cases where the IPA server name does not belong to the
   primary DNS domain and is not resolvable using DNS, create a DNS zone
   containing the IPA server name as well.

   This option requires that you either specify at least one DNS
   forwarder through the ``**--forwarder**`` option or use the
   ``**--no-forwarders**`` option.

   Note that you can set up a DNS at any time after the initial IPA
   server install by running **ipa-dns-install** (see
   **ipa-dns-install**\ (1)). IPA DNS cannot be uninstalled.

.. option:: --forwarder=<IP_ADDRESS>

   Add a DNS forwarder to the DNS configuration. You can use this option
   multiple times to specify more forwarders, but at least one must be
   provided, unless the ``**--no-forwarders**`` option is specified.

.. option:: --no-forwarders

   Do not add any DNS forwarders. Root DNS servers will be used instead.

.. option:: --auto-forwarders

   Add DNS forwarders configured in /etc/resolv.conf to the list of
   forwarders used by IPA DNS.

.. option:: --forward-policy=<first|only>

   DNS forwarding policy for global forwarders specified using other
   options. Defaults to first if no IP address belonging to a private or
   reserved ranges is detected on local interfaces (RFC 6303). Defaults
   to only if a private IP address is detected.

.. option:: --reverse-zone=<REVERSE_ZONE>

   The reverse DNS zone to use. This option can be used multiple times
   to specify multiple reverse zones.

.. option:: --no-reverse

   Do not create reverse DNS zone.

.. option:: --auto-reverse

   Try to resolve reverse records and reverse zones for server IP
   addresses. If neither is resolvable, creates the reverse zones.

.. option:: --zonemgr

   The e-mail address of the DNS zone manager. Defaults to
   hostmaster@DOMAIN

.. option:: --no-host-dns

   Do not use DNS for hostname lookup during installation.

.. option:: --no-dns-sshfp

   Do not automatically create DNS SSHFP records.

.. option:: --no-dnssec-validation

   Disable DNSSEC validation on this server.

.. option:: --allow-zone-overlap

   Allow creation of (reverse) zone even if the zone is already
   resolvable. Using this option is discouraged as it result in later
   problems with domain name resolution.

AD TRUST OPTIONS
----------------

.. option:: --setup-adtrust

   Configure AD Trust capability.

.. option:: --netbios-name=<NETBIOS_NAME>

   The NetBIOS name for the IPA domain. If not provided, this is
   determined based on the leading component of the DNS domain name.
   Running ipa-adtrust-install for a second time with a different
   NetBIOS name will change the name. Please note that changing the
   NetBIOS name might break existing trust relationships to other
   domains.

.. option:: --rid-base=<RID_BASE>

   First RID value of the local domain. The first POSIX ID of the local
   domain will be assigned to this RID, the second to RID+1 etc. See the
   online help of the idrange CLI for details.

.. option:: --secondary-rid-base=<SECONDARY_RID_BASE>

   Start value of the secondary RID range, which is only used in the
   case a user and a group share numerically the same POSIX ID. See the
   online help of the idrange CLI for details.

.. option:: --enable-compat

   Enables support for trusted domains users for old clients through
   Schema Compatibility plugin. SSSD supports trusted domains natively
   starting with version 1.9. For platforms that lack SSSD or run older
   SSSD version one needs to use this option. When enabled, slapi-nis
   package needs to be installed and schema-compat-plugin will be
   configured to provide lookup of users and groups from trusted domains
   via SSSD on IPA server. These users and groups will be available
   under **cn=users,cn=compat,$SUFFIX** and
   **cn=groups,cn=compat,$SUFFIX** trees. SSSD will normalize names of
   users and groups to lower case.

   In addition to providing these users and groups through the compat
   tree, this option enables authentication over LDAP for trusted domain
   users with DN under compat tree, i.e. using bind DN
   **uid=administrator@ad.domain,cn=users,cn=compat,$SUFFIX**.

   LDAP authentication performed by the compat tree is done via PAM
   '**system-auth**' service. This service exists by default on Linux
   systems and is provided by pam package as /etc/pam.d/system-auth. If
   your IPA install does not have default HBAC rule 'allow_all' enabled,
   then make sure to define in IPA special service called
   '**system-auth**' and create an HBAC rule to allow access to anyone
   to this rule on IPA masters.

   As '**system-auth**' PAM service is not used directly by any other
   application, it is safe to use it for trusted domain users via
   compatibility path.

UNINSTALL OPTIONS
-----------------

.. option:: --uninstall

   Uninstall an existing IPA installation.

``-U, --unattended``
   An unattended uninstallation that will never prompt for user input.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
==================

``-P <MASTER_PASSWORD>, --master-password=<MASTER_PASSWORD>``
   The kerberos master password (normally autogenerated).

EXIT STATUS
===========

0 if the (un)installation was successful

1 if an error occurred

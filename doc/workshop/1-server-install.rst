Unit 1: Installing the FreeIPA server
=======================================

In the preparation for this workshop, you created a container compose
consisting of three hosts:

- ``server``
- ``replica``
- ``client``

The hostnames for the hosts are:

- ``server.ipademo.local``
- ``replica.ipademo.local``
- ``client.ipademo.local``

Access the ``server`` host with::

  $ podman exec -it server bash

On ``server``, start the FreeIPA server installation program::

  [server]# ipa-server-install --mkhomedir --idstart=60001 --idmax=62000

The ``--idstart`` and ``--idmax`` options are used to limit the number
of users, and is required for the workshop's rootless containers. Their
use is out of the scope of this step.

On macOS, add the option ``--allow-zone-overlap``. This is required so
that DNS reverse zones can be configured due to the configuration used
by the podman virtual machine.

The ``--mkhomedir`` flag configures PAM to create missing home directories
when users log into the host for the first time. FreeIPA supports automount
so consider using that for production deployments.

You will be asked a series of questions. Accept the defaults for most
of the questions, except as outlined below.

Configure FreeIPA's DNS server::

  Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: yes


Accept default values for the server hostname, domain name and realm::

  Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
  on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
  <hostname>.<domainname>
  Example: master.example.com.


  Server host name [server.ipademo.local]:

  Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host server.ipademo.local
  The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

  Please confirm the domain name [ipademo.local]:

  The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
  This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

  Please provide a realm name [IPADEMO.LOCAL]:


Enter passwords for *Directory Manager* (used to manage the
directory server) and *admin* (the main account used for FreeIPA
administration).  Use something simple that you're not going to
forget during the workshop!

::

  Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
  This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
  to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
  instance of directory server created for IPA.
  The password must be at least 8 characters long.

  Directory Manager password:
  Password (confirm):

  The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
  This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

  IPA admin password:
  Password (confirm):


Do not configure a DNS forwarder (you will want to configure a DNS
forwarder for a real-world deployment but it is not needed for this
workshop) and accept the defaults for configuring the reverse zone::

  Checking DNS domain ipademo.local., please wait ...
  Do you want to configure DNS forwarders? [yes]: no
  No DNS forwarders configured
  Do you want to search for missing reverse zones? [yes]:
  Do you want to create reverse zone for IP 192.168.33.2 [yes]:

Next, you will be presented with a summary of the server
configuration and asked for final confirmation.  Give confirmation to begin
the server installation::

  The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
  Hostname:       server.ipademo.local
  IP address(es): 192.168.33.2
  Domain name:    ipademo.local
  Realm name:     IPADEMO.LOCAL

  The CA will be configured with:
  Subject DN:   CN=Certificate Authority,O=IPADEMO.LOCAL
  Subject base: O=IPADEMO.LOCAL
  Chaining:     self-signed

  BIND DNS server will be configured to serve IPA domain with:
  Forwarders:       No forwarders
  Forward policy:   only
  Reverse zone(s):  33.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

  Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes

The installation takes a few minutes; you will see output indicating
the progress.

When it completes, run ``kinit admin`` and enter your *admin*
password to obtain a Kerberos *ticket granting ticket* (TGT) for the
``admin`` user::

  [server]$ kinit admin
  Password for admin@IPADEMO.LOCAL:  <enter password>

Run ``klist`` to view your current Kerberos tickets::

  [server]$ klist
  Ticket cache: KEYRING:persistent:1000:1000
  Default principal: admin@IPADEMO.LOCAL

  Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
  10/15/15 01:48:59  10/16/15 01:48:57  krbtgt/IPADEMO.LOCAL@IPADEMO.LOCAL

The FreeIPA server is now set up and you are ready to begin
enrolling client machines, creating users, managing services, and
more!

To prepare for the next unit, exit the ``server``. The next essential unit
is :ref:`Unit 2: Enrolling client machines <2-client-install>`.

Alternatively, if you would like to immediately install a replica
server (essential for production deployments), you can take a detour
to :ref:`Unit 7: Replica installation <7-replica-install>`.

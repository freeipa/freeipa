.SH "NAME"
ipa\-join \- Join a machine to an IPA realm and get a keytab for the host service principal
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-join [ \fB\-h\fR hostname ] [ \fB\-k\fR keytab\-file ] [ \fB\-s\fR server ] [ \fB\-w\fR bulk\-bind\-password ] [\fB\-u\fR] [ \fB\-d\fR ] [ \fB\-q\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Joins a host to an IPA realm and retrieves a kerberos \fIkeytab\fR for the host service principal, or unenrolls an enrolled host from an IPA server.

Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos principal.

The ipa\-join command will create and retrieve a service principal for host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and place it by default into /etc/krb5.keytab. The location can be overridden with the \-k option.

The IPA server to contact is set in /etc/ipa/default.conf by default and can be overridden using the \-s,\-\-server option.

In order to join the machine needs to be authenticated. This can happen in one of two ways:

* Authenticate using the current kerberos principal

* Provide a password to authenticate with

If a client host has already been joined to the IPA realm the ipa\-join command will fail. The host will need to be removed from the server using `ipa host\-del FQDN` in order to join the client to the realm.

This command is normally executed by the ipa\-client\-install command as part of the enrollment process.

The reverse is unenrollment. Unenrolling a host removes the Kerberos key on the IPA server. This prepares the host to be re\-enrolled. This uses the host principal stored in /etc/krb5.conf to authenticate to the IPA server to perform the unenrollment.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-h,\-\-hostname hostname\fR
The hostname of this server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is used.
.TP
\fB\-s,\-\-server server\fR
The hostname of this server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is used.
.TP
\fB\-k,\-\-keytab keytab\-file\fR
The keytab file where to append the new key (will be created if it does not exist). Default: /etc/krb5.keytab
.TP
\fB\-w,\-\-bindpw password\fR
The password to use if not using kerberos to authenticate
.TP
\fB\-u,\-\-unenroll\fR
Unenroll this host from the IPA server
.TP
\fB\-q,\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.
.TP
\fB\-d,\-\-debug\fR
Debug mode.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab with kerberos credentials.

  # kinit admin
  # ipa\-join

Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab using a one\-time password.

  # ipa\-join \-w secret123

Join IPA domain and save the keytab in another location.

  # ipa\-join \-k /tmp/host.keytab
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The exit status is 0 on success, nonzero on error.

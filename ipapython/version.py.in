# Just the numeric portion of the version so one can do direct numeric
# comparisons to see if the API is compatible.
#
# How NUM_VERSION was generated changed over time:
# Before IPA 3.1.3, it was simply concatenated decimal numbers:
#   IPA 2.2.2:  NUM_VERSION=222
#   IPA 2.2.99: NUM_VERSION=2299 (development version)
#   IPA 3.1.0:  NUM_VERSION=310
#   IPA 3.1.3:  NUM_VERSION=313
# In IPA 3.1.4 and 3.2.0, the version was taken as an octal number due to a bug
# (https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3622):
#   IPA 3.1.4:  NUM_VERSION=12356 (octal 030104)
#   IPA 3.2.0:  NUM_VERSION=12416 (octal 030200)
# After IPA 3.2.0, it is decimal number where each part has two digits:
#   IPA 3.2.1:  NUM_VERSION=30201
#   IPA 3.2.99: NUM_VERSION=30299 (development version)
#   IPA 3.3.0:  NUM_VERSION=30300

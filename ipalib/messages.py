"""
Custom message (debug, info, warning) classes passed through RPC.

These are added to the "messages" entry in a RPC response, and printed to the
user as log messages.

Each message class has a unique numeric "errno" attribute from the 10000-10999
range, so that it does not clash with PublicError numbers.

Messages also have the 'type' argument, set to one of 'debug', 'info',
'warning', 'error'. This determines the severity of the message.

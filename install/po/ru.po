"Directory Server Access Control Instructions (ACIs)\n"
"\n"
"ACIs are used to allow or deny access to information. This module is\n"
"currently designed to allow, not deny, access.\n"
"\n"
"The aci commands are designed to grant permissions that allow updating\n"
"existing entries or adding or deleting new ones. The goal of the ACIs\n"
"that ship with IPA is to provide a set of low-level permissions that\n"
"grant access to special groups called taskgroups. These low-level\n"
"permissions can be combined into roles that grant broader access. These\n"
"roles are another type of group, roles.\n"
"\n"
"For example, if you have taskgroups that allow adding and modifying users you\n"
"could create a role, useradmin. You would assign users to the useradmin\n"
"role to allow them to do the operations defined by the taskgroups.\n"
"\n"
"You can create ACIs that delegate permission so users in group A can write\n"
"attributes on group B.\n"
"\n"
"The type option is a map that applies to all entries in the users, groups or\n"
"host location. It is primarily designed to be used when granting add\n"
"permissions (to write new entries).\n"
"\n"
"An ACI consists of three parts:\n"
"1. target\n"
"2. permissions\n"
"3. bind rules\n"
"\n"
"The target is a set of rules that define which LDAP objects are being\n"
"targeted. This can include a list of attributes, an area of that LDAP\n"
"tree or an LDAP filter.\n"
"\n"
"The targets include:\n"
"- attrs: list of attributes affected\n"
"- type: an object type (user, group, host, service, etc)\n"
"- memberof: members of a group\n"
"- targetgroup: grant access to modify a specific group. This is primarily\n"
"  designed to enable users to add or remove members of a specific group.\n"
"- filter: A legal LDAP filter used to narrow the scope of the target.\n"
"- subtree: Used to apply a rule across an entire set of objects. For example,\n"
"  to allow adding users you need to grant \"add\" permission to the subtree\n"
"  ldap://uid=*,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com. The subtree option\n"
"  is a fail-safe for objects that may not be covered by the type option.\n"
"\n"
"The permissions define what the the ACI is allowed to do, and are one or\n"
"more of:\n"
"1. write - write one or more attributes\n"
"2. read - read one or more attributes\n"
"3. add - add a new entry to the tree\n"
"4. delete - delete an existing entry\n"
"5. all - all permissions are granted\n"
"\n"
"Note the distinction between attributes and entries. The permissions are\n"
"independent, so being able to add a user does not mean that the user will\n"
"be editable.\n"
"\n"
"The bind rule defines who this ACI grants permissions to. The LDAP server\n"
"allows this to be any valid LDAP entry but we encourage the use of\n"
"taskgroups so that the rights can be easily shared through roles.\n"
"\n"
"For a more thorough description of access controls see\n"
"http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/ag/8.0/Managing_Access_Control.html\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: ACIs are now added via the permission plugin. These examples are to\n"
"demonstrate how the various options work but this is done via the permission\n"
"command-line now (see last example).\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI so that the group \"secretaries\" can update the address on any user:\n"
"   ipa group-add --desc=\"Office secretaries\" secretaries\n"
"   ipa aci-add --attrs=streetAddress --memberof=ipausers --group=secretaries --permissions=write --prefix=none \"Secretaries write addresses\"\n"
"\n"
" Show the new ACI:\n"
"   ipa aci-show --prefix=none \"Secretaries write addresses\"\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI that allows members of the \"addusers\" permission to add new users:\n"
"   ipa aci-add --type=user --permission=addusers --permissions=add --prefix=none \"Add new users\"\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI that allows members of the editors manage members of the admins group:\n"
"   ipa aci-add --permissions=write --attrs=member --targetgroup=admins --group=editors --prefix=none \"Editors manage admins\"\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI that allows members of the admin group to manage the street and zip code of those in the editors group:\n"
"   ipa aci-add --permissions=write --memberof=editors --group=admins --attrs=street,postalcode --prefix=none \"admins edit the address of editors\"\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI that allows the admins group manage the street and zipcode of those who work for the boss:\n"
"   ipa aci-add --permissions=write --group=admins --attrs=street,postalcode --filter=\"(manager=uid=boss,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com)\" --prefix=none \"Edit the address of those who work for the boss\"\n"
"\n"
" Add an entirely new kind of record to IPA that isn't covered by any of the --type options, creating a permission:\n"
"   ipa permission-add  --permissions=add --subtree=\"cn=*,cn=orange,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com\" --desc=\"Add Orange Entries\" add_orange\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The show command shows the raw 389-ds ACI.\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: When modifying the target attributes of an existing ACI you\n"
"must include all existing attributes as well. When doing an aci-mod the\n"
"targetattr REPLACES the current attributes, it does not add to them.\n"

"\n"
"Stores automount(8) configuration for autofs(8) in IPA.\n"
"\n"
"The base of an automount configuration is the configuration file auto.master.\n"
"This is also the base location in IPA. Multiple auto.master configurations\n"
"can be stored in separate locations. A location is implementation-specific\n"
"with the default being a location named 'default'. For example, you can have\n"
"locations by geographic region, by floor, by type, etc.\n"
"\n"
"Automount has three basic object types: locations, maps and keys.\n"
"\n"
"A location defines a set of maps anchored in auto.master. This allows you\n"
"to store multiple automount configurations. A location in itself isn't\n"
"very interesting, it is just a point to start a new automount map.\n"
"\n"
"A map is roughly equivalent to a discrete automount file and provides\n"
"storage for keys.\n"
"\n"
"A key is a mount point associated with a map.\n"
"\n"
"When a new location is created, two maps are automatically created for\n"
"it: auto.master and auto.direct. auto.master is the root map for all\n"
"automount maps for the location. auto.direct is the default map for\n"
"direct mounts and is mounted on /-.\n"

"A host represents a machine. It can be used in a number of contexts:\n"

"- a host can be used in Host-based Access Control (HBAC) rules\n"
"- every enrolled client generates a host entry\n"

"ENROLLMENT:\n"
"\n"
"There are three enrollment scenarios when enrolling a new client:\n"
"\n"
"1. You are enrolling as a full administrator. The host entry may exist\n"
"   or not. A full administrator is a member of the hostadmin role\n"
"   or the admins group.\n"
"2. You are enrolling as a limited administrator. The host must already\n"
"   exist. A limited administrator is a member a role with the\n"
"   Host Enrollment privilege.\n"
"3. The host has been created with a one-time password.\n"
"\n"
"A host can only be enrolled once. If a client has enrolled and needs to\n"
"be re-enrolled, the host entry must be removed and re-created. Note that\n"
"re-creating the host entry will result in all services for the host being\n"
"removed, and all SSL certificates associated with those services being\n"
"revoked.\n"

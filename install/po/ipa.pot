"Directory Server Access Control Instructions (ACIs)\n"
"\n"
"ACIs are used to allow or deny access to information. This module is\n"
"currently designed to allow, not deny, access.\n"
"\n"
"The aci commands are designed to grant permissions that allow updating\n"
"existing entries or adding or deleting new ones. The goal of the ACIs\n"
"that ship with IPA is to provide a set of low-level permissions that\n"
"grant access to special groups called taskgroups. These low-level\n"
"permissions can be combined into roles that grant broader access. These\n"
"roles are another type of group, roles.\n"
"\n"
"For example, if you have taskgroups that allow adding and modifying users "
"you\n"
"could create a role, useradmin. You would assign users to the useradmin\n"
"role to allow them to do the operations defined by the taskgroups.\n"
"\n"
"You can create ACIs that delegate permission so users in group A can write\n"
"attributes on group B.\n"
"\n"
"The type option is a map that applies to all entries in the users, groups "
"or\n"
"host location. It is primarily designed to be used when granting add\n"
"permissions (to write new entries).\n"
"\n"
"An ACI consists of three parts:\n"
"1. target\n"
"2. permissions\n"
"3. bind rules\n"
"\n"
"The target is a set of rules that define which LDAP objects are being\n"
"targeted. This can include a list of attributes, an area of that LDAP\n"
"tree or an LDAP filter.\n"
"\n"
"The targets include:\n"
"- attrs: list of attributes affected\n"
"- type: an object type (user, group, host, service, etc)\n"
"- memberof: members of a group\n"
"- targetgroup: grant access to modify a specific group. This is primarily\n"
"  designed to enable users to add or remove members of a specific group.\n"
"- filter: A legal LDAP filter used to narrow the scope of the target.\n"
"- subtree: Used to apply a rule across an entire set of objects. For "
"example,\n"
"  to allow adding users you need to grant \"add\" permission to the subtree\n"
"  ldap://uid=*,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com. The subtree option\n"
"  is a fail-safe for objects that may not be covered by the type option.\n"
"\n"
"The permissions define what the ACI is allowed to do, and are one or\n"
"more of:\n"
"1. write - write one or more attributes\n"
"2. read - read one or more attributes\n"
"3. add - add a new entry to the tree\n"
"4. delete - delete an existing entry\n"
"5. all - all permissions are granted\n"
"\n"
"Note the distinction between attributes and entries. The permissions are\n"
"independent, so being able to add a user does not mean that the user will\n"
"be editable.\n"
"\n"
"The bind rule defines who this ACI grants permissions to. The LDAP server\n"
"allows this to be any valid LDAP entry but we encourage the use of\n"
"taskgroups so that the rights can be easily shared through roles.\n"
"\n"
"For a more thorough description of access controls see\n"
"http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/ag/8.0/Managing_Access_Control."
"html\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: ACIs are now added via the permission plugin. These examples are to\n"
"demonstrate how the various options work but this is done via the "
"permission\n"
"command-line now (see last example).\n"
"\n"
" Add an ACI so that the group \"secretaries\" can update the address on any "
"user:\n"
"   ipa group-add --desc=\"Office secretaries\" secretaries\n"
"   ipa aci-add --attrs=streetAddress --memberof=ipausers --group=secretaries "
"--permissions=write --prefix=none \"Secretaries write addresses\"\n"
"\n"
" Show the new ACI:\n"

"This is also the base location in IPA. Multiple auto.master configurations\n"
"can be stored in separate locations. A location is implementation-specific\n"
"with the default being a location named 'default'. For example, you can "

"locations by geographic region, by floor, by type, etc.\n"
"\n"
"Automount has three basic object types: locations, maps and keys.\n"

"A location defines a set of maps anchored in auto.master. This allows you\n"

"very interesting, it is just a point to start a new automount map.\n"
"\n"
"A map is roughly equivalent to a discrete automount file and provides\n"

"A key is a mount point associated with a map.\n"
"\n"
"When a new location is created, two maps are automatically created for\n"
"it: auto.master and auto.direct. auto.master is the root map for all\n"
"automount maps for the location. auto.direct is the default map for\n"
"direct mounts and is mounted on /-.\n"
"\n"
"An automount map may contain a submount key. This key defines a mount\n"

"SUPPORTED ZONE TYPES\n"
"\n"
" * Master zone (dnszone-*), contains authoritative data.\n"
" * Forward zone (dnsforwardzone-*), forwards queries to configured "
"forwarders\n"
" (a set of DNS servers).\n"
"\n"
"USING STRUCTURED PER-TYPE OPTIONS\n"
"\n"
"There are many structured DNS RR types where DNS data stored in LDAP server\n"
"is not just a scalar value, for example an IP address or a domain name, but\n"
"a data structure which may be often complex. A good example is a LOC record\n"
"[RFC1876] which consists of many mandatory and optional parts (degrees,\n"
"minutes, seconds of latitude and longitude, altitude or precision).\n"
"\n"
"It may be difficult to manipulate such DNS records without making a mistake\n"
"and entering an invalid value. DNS module provides an abstraction over "
"these\n"
"raw records and allows to manipulate each RR type with specific options. "
"For\n"
"each supported RR type, DNS module provides a standard option to manipulate\n"
"a raw records with format --<rrtype>-rec, e.g. --mx-rec, and special "
"options\n"
"for every part of the RR structure with format --<rrtype>-<partname>, e.g.\n"
"--mx-preference and --mx-exchanger.\n"
"\n"
"When adding a record, either RR specific options or standard option for a "
"raw\n"
"value can be used, they just should not be combined in one add operation. "
"When\n"
"modifying an existing entry, new RR specific options can be used to change\n"
"one part of a DNS record, where the standard option for raw value is used\n"
"to specify the modified value. The following example demonstrates\n"
"a modification of MX record preference from 0 to 1 in a record without\n"
"modifying the exchanger:\n"
"ipa dnsrecord-mod --mx-rec=\"0 mx.example.com.\" --mx-preference=1\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Manage ID ranges  used to map Posix IDs to SIDs and back.\n"
"\n"
"There are two type of ID ranges which are both handled by this utility:\n"
"\n"
" - the ID ranges of the local domain\n"
" - the ID ranges of trusted remote domains\n"
"\n"
"Both types have the following attributes in common:\n"
"\n"
" - base-id: the first ID of the Posix ID range\n"
" - range-size: the size of the range\n"
"\n"
"With those two attributes a range object can reserve the Posix IDs starting\n"
"with base-id up to but not including base-id+range-size exclusively.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally an ID range of the local domain may set\n"
" - rid-base: the first RID(*) of the corresponding RID range\n"
" - secondary-rid-base: first RID of the secondary RID range\n"
"\n"
"and an ID range of a trusted domain must set\n"
" - rid-base: the first RID of the corresponding RID range\n"
" - sid: domain SID of the trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: Add a new ID range for a trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"Since there might be more than one trusted domain the domain SID must be "
"given\n"
"while creating the ID range.\n"
"\n"
"  ipa idrange-add --base-id=1200000 --range-size=200000 --rid-"
"base=0                   --dom-sid=S-1-5-21-123-456-789 trusted_dom_range\n"
"\n"
"This ID range is then used by the IPA server and the SSSD IPA provider to\n"
"assign Posix UIDs to users from the trusted domain.\n"
"\n"
"If e.g a range for a trusted domain is configured with the following "
"values:\n"
" base-id = 1200000\n"
" range-size = 200000\n"
" rid-base = 0\n"
"the RIDs 0 to 199999 are mapped to the Posix ID from 1200000 to 13999999. "
"So\n"
"RID 1000 <-> Posix ID 1201000\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: Add a new ID range for the local domain\n"
"\n"
"To create an ID range for the local domain it is not necessary to specify a\n"
"domain SID. But since it is possible that a user and a group can have the "
"same\n"
"value as Posix ID a second RID interval is needed to handle conflicts.\n"
"\n"
"  ipa idrange-add --base-id=1200000 --range-size=200000 --rid-"
"base=1000                   --secondary-rid-base=1000000 local_range\n"
"\n"
"The data from the ID ranges of the local domain are used by the IPA server\n"
"internally to assign SIDs to IPA users and groups. The SID will then be "
"stored\n"
"in the user or group objects.\n"
"\n"
"If e.g. the ID range for the local domain is configured with the values "
"from\n"
"the example above then a new user with the UID 1200007 will get the RID "
"1007.\n"
"If this RID is already used by a group the RID will be 1000007. This can "
"only\n"
"happen if a user or a group object was created with a fixed ID because the\n"
"automatic assignment will not assign the same ID twice. Since there are "
"only\n"
"users and groups sharing the same ID namespace it is sufficient to have "
"only\n"
"one fallback range to handle conflicts.\n"
"\n"
"To find the Posix ID for a given RID from the local domain it has to be\n"
"checked first if the RID falls in the primary or secondary RID range and\n"
"the rid-base or the secondary-rid-base has to be subtracted, respectively,\n"
"and the base-id has to be added to get the Posix ID.\n"
"\n"
"Typically the creation of ID ranges happens behind the scenes and this CLI\n"
"must not be used at all. The ID range for the local domain will be created\n"
"during installation or upgrade from an older version. The ID range for a\n"
"trusted domain will be created together with the trust by 'ipa trust-"
"add ...'.\n"
"\n"
"USE CASES:\n"
"\n"
"  Add an ID range from a transitively trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the trusted domain (A) trusts another domain (B) as well and this "
"trust\n"
"    is transitive 'ipa trust-add domain-A' will only create a range for\n"
"    domain A.  The ID range for domain B must be added manually.\n"
"\n"
"  Add an additional ID range for the local domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the ID range of the local domain is exhausted, i.e. no new IDs can "
"be\n"
"    assigned to Posix users or groups by the DNA plugin, a new range has to "
"be\n"
"    created to allow new users and groups to be added. (Currently there is "
"no\n"
"    connection between this range CLI and the DNA plugin, but a future "
"version\n"
"    might be able to modify the configuration of the DNS plugin as well)\n"
"\n"
"In general it is not necessary to modify or delete ID ranges. If there is "
"no\n"
"other way to achieve a certain configuration than to modify or delete an ID\n"
"range it should be done with great care. Because UIDs are stored in the "
"file\n"
"system and are used for access control it might be possible that users are\n"
"allowed to access files of other users if an ID range got deleted and "
"reused\n"
"for a different domain.\n"
"\n"
"(*) The RID is typically the last integer of a user or group SID which "
"follows\n"
"the domain SID. E.g. if the domain SID is S-1-5-21-123-456-789 and a user "
"from\n"
"this domain has the SID S-1-5-21-123-456-789-1010 then 1010 id the RID of "
"the\n"
"user. RIDs are unique in a domain, 32bit values and are used for users and\n"
"groups.\n"
"\n"
"WARNING:\n"
"\n"
"DNA plugin in 389-ds will allocate IDs based on the ranges configured for "
"the\n"
"local domain. Currently the DNA plugin *cannot* be reconfigured itself "
"based\n"
"on the local ranges set via this family of commands.\n"
"\n"
"Manual configuration change has to be done in the DNA plugin configuration "
"for\n"
"the new local range. Specifically, The dnaNextRange attribute of 'cn=Posix\n"
"IDs,cn=Distributed Numeric Assignment Plugin,cn=plugins,cn=config' has to "

"Migrate users and groups from an LDAP server to IPA.\n"
"\n"
"This performs an LDAP query against the remote server searching for\n"
"users and groups in a container. In order to migrate passwords you need\n"
"to bind as a user that can read the userPassword attribute on the remote\n"
"server. This is generally restricted to high-level admins such as\n"
"cn=Directory Manager in 389-ds (this is the default bind user).\n"
"\n"
"The default user container is ou=People.\n"
"\n"
"The default group container is ou=Groups.\n"
"\n"
"Users and groups that already exist on the IPA server are skipped.\n"
"\n"
"Two LDAP schemas define how group members are stored: RFC2307 and\n"
"RFC2307bis. RFC2307bis uses member and uniquemember to specify group\n"
"members, RFC2307 uses memberUid. The default schema is RFC2307bis.\n"
"\n"
"The schema compat feature allows IPA to reformat data for systems that\n"
"do not support RFC2307bis. It is recommended that this feature is disabled\n"
"during migration to reduce system overhead. It can be re-enabled after\n"
"migration. To migrate with it enabled use the \"--with-compat\" option.\n"
"\n"
"Migrated users do not have Kerberos credentials, they have only their\n"
"LDAP password. To complete the migration process, users need to go\n"
"to http://ipa.example.com/ipa/migration and authenticate using their\n"

"\n"
"Migration is disabled by default. Use the command ipa config-mod to\n"

"\n"
" ipa config-mod --enable-migration=TRUE\n"

"Users are added as members to the default user group. This can be a\n"

"mode for every 100 users. As a result there will be a window in which\n"
"users will be added to IPA but will not be members of the default\n"

"Permissions\n"
"\n"
"A permission enables fine-grained delegation of rights. A permission is\n"
"a human-readable wrapper around a 389-ds Access Control Rule,\n"
"or instruction (ACI).\n"
"A permission grants the right to perform a specific task such as adding a\n"
"user, modifying a group, etc.\n"
"\n"
"A permission may not contain other permissions.\n"
"\n"
"* A permission grants access to read, write, add, delete, read, search,\n"
"  or compare.\n"
"* A privilege combines similar permissions (for example all the permissions\n"
"  needed to add a user).\n"
"* A role grants a set of privileges to users, groups, hosts or hostgroups.\n"
"\n"
"A permission is made up of a number of different parts:\n"
"\n"
"1. The name of the permission.\n"
"2. The target of the permission.\n"
"3. The rights granted by the permission.\n"
"\n"
"Rights define what operations are allowed, and may be one or more\n"
"of the following:\n"
"1. write - write one or more attributes\n"
"2. read - read one or more attributes\n"
"3. search - search on one or more attributes\n"
"4. compare - compare one or more attributes\n"
"5. add - add a new entry to the tree\n"
"6. delete - delete an existing entry\n"
"7. all - all permissions are granted\n"
"\n"
"Note the distinction between attributes and entries. The permissions are\n"
"independent, so being able to add a user does not mean that the user will\n"
"be editable.\n"
"\n"
"There are a number of allowed targets:\n"
"1. subtree: a DN; the permission applies to the subtree under this DN\n"
"2. target filter: an LDAP filter\n"
"3. target: DN with possible wildcards, specifies entries permission applies "
"to\n"
"\n"
"Additionally, there are the following convenience options.\n"
"Setting one of these options will set the corresponding attribute(s).\n"
"1. type: a type of object (user, group, etc); sets subtree and target "
"filter.\n"
"2. memberof: apply to members of a group; sets target filter\n"
"3. targetgroup: grant access to modify a specific group (such as granting\n"
"   the rights to manage group membership); sets target.\n"
"\n"
"Managed permissions\n"
"\n"
"Permissions that come with IPA by default can be so-called \"managed\"\n"
"permissions. These have a default set of attributes they apply to,\n"
"but the administrator can add/remove individual attributes to/from the set.\n"
"\n"
"Deleting or renaming a managed permission, as well as changing its target,\n"
"is not allowed.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
" Add a permission that grants the creation of users:\n"
"   ipa permission-add --type=user --permissions=add \"Add Users\"\n"
"\n"
" Add a permission that grants the ability to manage group membership:\n"
"   ipa permission-add --attrs=member --permissions=write --type=group "
"\"Manage Group Members\"\n"

"\n"
"A IPA service represents a service that runs on a host. The IPA service\n"
"record can store a Kerberos principal, an SSL certificate, or both.\n"
"\n"
"An IPA service can be managed directly from a machine, provided that\n"
"machine has been given the correct permission. This is true even for\n"
"machines other than the one the service is associated with. For example,\n"
"requesting an SSL certificate using the host service principal credentials\n"
"of the host. To manage a service using host credentials you need to\n"
"kinit as the host:\n"
"\n"
" # kinit -kt /etc/krb5.keytab host/ipa.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\n"
"\n"
"Adding an IPA service allows the associated service to request an SSL\n"
"certificate or keytab, but this is performed as a separate step; they\n"
"are not produced as a result of adding the service.\n"
"\n"
"Only the public aspect of a certificate is stored in a service record;\n"
"the private key is not stored.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
" Add a new IPA service:\n"
"   ipa service-add HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"\n"
" Allow a host to manage an IPA service certificate:\n"
"   ipa service-add-host --hosts=web.example.com HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"   ipa role-add-member --hosts=web.example.com certadmin\n"
"\n"
" Override a default list of supported PAC types for the service:\n"
"   ipa service-mod HTTP/web.example.com --pac-type=MS-PAC\n"
"\n"
"   A typical use case where overriding the PAC type is needed is NFS.\n"
"   Currently the related code in the Linux kernel can only handle Kerberos\n"
"   tickets up to a maximal size. Since the PAC data can become quite large "
"it\n"
"   is recommended to set --pac-type=NONE for NFS services.\n"
"\n"
" Delete an IPA service:\n"
"   ipa service-del HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"\n"
" Find all IPA services associated with a host:\n"
"   ipa service-find web.example.com\n"

"\n"
"Issues\n"
"======\n"
"\n"
"Cookies\n"
"-------\n"
"\n"
"Most session implementations are based on the use of cookies. Cookies\n"
"have some inherent problems.\n"
"\n"
"* User has the option to disable cookies.\n"
"\n"
"* User stored cookie data is not secure. Can be mitigated by setting\n"
"  flags indicating the cookie is only to be used with SSL secured HTTP\n"
"  connections to specific web resources and setting the cookie to\n"
"  expire at session termination. Most modern browsers enforce these.\n"
"\n"
"Where to store session data?\n"
"----------------------------\n"
"\n"
"Session data may be stored on either on the client or on the\n"
"server. Storing session data on the client addresses the problem of\n"
"session data availability when requests are serviced by independent web\n"
"servers because the session data travels with the request. However\n"
"there are data size limitations. Storing session data on the client\n"
"also exposes sensitive data but this can be mitigated by encrypting\n"
"the session data such that only the server can decrypt it.\n"
"\n"
"The more conventional approach is to bind session data to a unique\n"
"name, the session ID. The session ID is transmitted to the client and\n"
"the session data is paired with the session ID on the server in a\n"
"associative data store. The session data is retrieved by the server\n"
"using the session ID when the receiving the request. This eliminates\n"
"exposing sensitive session data on the client along with limitations\n"
"on data size. It however introduces the issue of session data\n"
"availability when requests are serviced by more than one server\n"
"process.\n"
"\n"
"Multi-process session data availability\n"
"---------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"Apache (and other web servers) fork child processes to handle requests\n"
"in parallel. Also web servers may be deployed in a farm where requests\n"
"are load balanced in round robin fashion across different nodes. In\n"
"both cases session data cannot be stored in the memory of a server\n"
"process because it is not available to other processes, either sibling\n"
"children of a master server process or server processes on distinct\n"
"nodes.\n"
"\n"
"Typically this is addressed by storing session data in a SQL\n"
"database. When a request is received by a server process containing a\n"
"session ID in it's cookie data the session ID is used to perform a SQL\n"
"query and the resulting data is then attached to the request as it\n"
"proceeds through the request processing pipeline. This of course\n"
"introduces coherency issues.\n"
"\n"
"For IPA the introduction of a SQL database dependency is undesired and\n"
"should be avoided.\n"
"\n"
"Session data may also be shared by independent processes by storing\n"
"the session data in files.\n"
"\n"
"An alternative solution which has gained considerable popularity\n"
"recently is the use of a fast memory based caching server. Data is\n"
"stored in a single process memory and may be queried and set via a\n"
"light weight protocol using standard socket mechanisms, memcached is\n"
"one example. A typical use is to optimize SQL queries by storing a SQL\n"
"result in shared memory cache avoiding the more expensive SQL\n"
"operation. But the memory cache has distinct advantages in non-SQL\n"
"situations as well.\n"
"\n"
"Possible implementations for use by IPA\n"
"=======================================\n"
"\n"
"Apache Sessions\n"
"---------------\n"
"\n"
"Apache has 2.3 has implemented session support via these modules:\n"
"\n"
"  mod_session\n"
"    Overarching session support based on cookies.\n"
"\n"
"    See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_session.html\n"
"\n"
"  mod_session_cookie\n"
"    Stores session data in the client.\n"
"\n"
"    See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_session_cookie.html\n"
"\n"
"  mod_session_crypto\n"
"    Encrypts session data for security. Encryption key is shared\n"
"    configuration parameter visible to all Apache processes and is\n"
"    stored in a configuration file.\n"
"\n"
"    See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_session_crypto.html\n"
"\n"
"  mod_session_dbd\n"
"    Stores session data in a SQL database permitting multiple\n"
"    processes to access and share the same session data.\n"
"\n"
"    See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_session_dbd.html\n"
"\n"
"Issues with Apache sessions\n"
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n"
"\n"
"Although Apache has implemented generic session support and Apache is\n"
"our web server of preference it nonetheless introduces issues for IPA.\n"
"\n"
"  * Session support is only available in httpd >= 2.3 which at the\n"
"    time of this writing is currently only available as a Beta release\n"
"    from upstream. We currently only ship httpd 2.2, the same is true\n"
"    for other distributions.\n"
"\n"
"  * We could package and ship the sessions modules as a temporary\n"
"    package in httpd 2.2 environments. But this has the following\n"
"    consequences:\n"
"\n"
"      - The code has to be backported. the module API has changed\n"
"        slightly between httpd 2.2 and 2.3. The backporting is not\n"
"        terribly difficult and a proof of concept has been\n"
"        implemented.\n"
"\n"
"      - We would then be on the hook to package and maintain a special\n"
"        case Apache package. This is maintenance burden as well as a\n"
"        distribution packaging burden. Both of which would be best\n"
"        avoided if possible.\n"
"\n"
"  * The design of the Apache session modules is such that they can\n"
"    only be manipulated by other Apache modules. The ability of\n"
"    consumers of the session data to control the session data is\n"
"    simplistic, constrained and static during the period the request\n"
"    is processed. Request handlers which are not native Apache modules\n"
"    (e.g. IPA via WSGI) can only examine the session data\n"
"    via request headers and reset it in response headers.\n"
"\n"
"  * Shared session data is available exclusively via SQL.\n"
"\n"
"However using the 2.3 Apache session modules would give us robust\n"
"session support implemented in C based on standardized Apache\n"
"interfaces which are widely used.\n"
"\n"
"Python Web Frameworks\n"
"---------------------\n"
"\n"
"Virtually every Python web framework supports cookie based sessions,\n"
"e.g. Django, Twisted, Zope, Turbogears etc. Early on in IPA we decided\n"
"to avoid the use of these frameworks. Trying to pull in just one part\n"
"of these frameworks just to get session support would be problematic\n"
"because the code does not function outside it's framework.\n"
"\n"
"IPA implemented sessions\n"
"------------------------\n"
"\n"
"Originally it was believed the path of least effort was to utilize\n"
"existing session support, most likely what would be provided by\n"
"Apache. However there are enough basic modular components available in\n"
"native Python and other standard packages it should be possible to\n"
"provide session support meeting the aforementioned goals with a modest\n"
"implementation effort. Because we're leveraging existing components\n"
"the implementation difficulties are subsumed by other components which\n"
"have already been field proven and have community support. This is a\n"
"smart strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Proposed Solution\n"
"=================\n"
"\n"
"Our interface to the web server is via WSGI which invokes a callback\n"
"per request passing us an environmental context for the request. For\n"
"this discussion we'll name the WSGI callback \"application()\", a\n"
"conventional name in WSGI parlance.\n"
"\n"
"Shared session data will be handled by memcached. We will create one\n"
"instance of memcached on each server node dedicated to IPA\n"
"exclusively. Communication with memcached will be via a UNIX socket\n"
"located in the file system under /var/run/ipa_memcached. It will be\n"
"protected by file permissions and optionally SELinux policy.\n"
"\n"
"In application() we examine the request cookies and if there is an IPA\n"
"session cookie with a session ID we retrieve the session data from our\n"
"memcached instance.\n"
"\n"
"The session data will be a Python dict. IPA components will read or\n"
"write their session information by using a pre-agreed upon name\n"
"(e.g. key) in the dict. This is a very flexible system and consistent\n"
"with how we pass data in most parts of IPA.\n"
"\n"
"If the session data is not available an empty session data dict will\n"
"be created.\n"
"\n"
"How does this session data travel with the request in the IPA\n"
"pipeline? In IPA we use the HTTP request/response to implement RPC. In\n"
"application() we convert the request into a procedure call passing it\n"
"arguments derived from the HTTP request. The passed parameters are\n"
"specific to the RPC method being invoked. The context the RPC call is\n"
"executing in is not passed as an RPC parameter.\n"
"\n"
"How would the contextual information such as session data be bound to\n"
"the request and hence the RPC call?\n"
"\n"
"In IPA when a RPC invocation is being prepared from a request we\n"
"recognize this will only ever be processed serially by one Python\n"
"thread. A thread local dict called \"context\" is allocated for each\n"
"thread. The context dict is cleared in between requests (e.g. RPC method\n"
"invocations). The per-thread context dict is populated during the\n"
"lifetime of the request and is used as a global data structure unique to\n"
"the request that various IPA component can read from and write to with\n"
"the assurance the data is unique to the current request and/or method\n"
"call.\n"
"\n"
"The session data dict will be written into the context dict under the\n"
"session key before the RPC method begins execution. Thus session data\n"
"can be read and written by any IPA component by accessing\n"
"``context.session``.\n"
"\n"
"When the RPC method finishes execution the session data bound to the\n"
"request/method is retrieved from the context and written back to the\n"
"memcached instance. The session ID is set in the response sent back to\n"
"the client in the ``Set-Cookie`` header along with the flags\n"
"controlling it's usage.\n"
"\n"
"Issues and details\n"
"------------------\n"
"\n"
"IPA code cannot depend on session data being present, however it\n"
"should always update session data with the hope it will be available\n"
"in the future. Session data may not be available because:\n"
"\n"
"  * This is the first request from the user and no session data has\n"
"    been created yet.\n"
"\n"
"  * The user may have cookies disabled.\n"
"\n"
"  * The session data may have been flushed. memcached operates with\n"
"    a fixed memory allocation and will flush entries on a LRU basis,\n"
"    like with any cache there is no guarantee of persistence.\n"
"\n"
"    Also we may have have deliberately expired or deleted session\n"
"    data, see below.\n"
"\n"
"Cookie manipulation is done via the standard Python Cookie module.\n"
"\n"
"Session cookies will be set to only persist as long as the browser has\n"
"the session open. They will be tagged so the browser only returns\n"
"the session ID on SSL secured HTTP requests. They will not be visible\n"
"to Javascript in the browser.\n"
"\n"
"Session ID's will be created by using 48 bits of random data and\n"
"converted to 12 hexadecimal digits. Newly generated session ID's will\n"
"be checked for prior existence to handle the unlikely case the random\n"
"number repeats.\n"
"\n"
"memcached will have significantly higher performance than a SQL or file\n"
"based storage solution. Communication is effectively though a pipe\n"
"(UNIX socket) using a very simple protocol and the data is held\n"
"entirely in process memory. memcached also scales easily, it is easy\n"
"to add more memcached processes and distribute the load across them.\n"
"At this point in time we don't anticipate the need for this.\n"
"\n"
"A very nice feature of the Python memcached module is that when a data\n"
"item is written to the cache it is done with standard Python pickling\n"
"(pickling is a standard Python mechanism to marshal and unmarshal\n"
"Python objects). We adopt the convention the object written to cache\n"
"will be a dict to meet our internal data handling conventions. The\n"
"pickling code will recursively handle nested objects in the dict. Thus\n"
"we gain a lot of flexibility using standard Python data structures to\n"
"store and retrieve our session data without having to author and debug\n"
"code to marshal and unmarshal the data if some other storage mechanism\n"
"had been used. This is a significant implementation win. Of course\n"
"some common sense limitations need to observed when deciding on what\n"
"is written to the session cache keeping in mind the data is shared\n"
"between processes and it should not be excessively large (a\n"
"configurable option)\n"
"\n"
"We can set an expiration on memcached entries. We may elect to do that\n"
"to force session data to be refreshed periodically. For example we may\n"
"wish the client to present fresh credentials on a periodic basis even\n"
"if the cached credentials are otherwise within their validity period.\n"
"\n"
"We can explicitly delete session data if for some reason we believe it\n"
"is stale, invalid or compromised.\n"
"\n"
"memcached also gives us certain facilities to prevent race conditions\n"
"between different processes utilizing the cache. For example you can\n"
"check of the entry has been modified since you last read it or use CAS\n"
"(Check And Set) semantics. What has to be protected in terms of cache\n"
"coherency will likely have to be determined as the session support is\n"
"utilized and different data items are added to the cache. This is very\n"
"much data and context specific. Fortunately memcached operations are\n"
"atomic.\n"
"\n"
"Controlling the memcached process\n"
"---------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"We need a mechanism to start the memcached process and secure it so\n"
"that only IPA components can access it.\n"
"\n"
"Although memcached ships with both an initscript and systemd unit\n"
"files those are for generic instances. We want a memcached instance\n"
"dedicated exclusively to IPA usage. To accomplish this we would install\n"
"a systemd unit file or an SysV initscript to control the IPA specific\n"
"memcached service. ipactl would be extended to know about this\n"
"additional service. systemd's cgroup facility would give us additional\n"
"mechanisms to integrate the IPA memcached service within a larger IPA\n"
"process group.\n"
"\n"
"Protecting the memcached data would be done via file permissions (and\n"
"optionally SELinux policy) on the UNIX domain socket. Although recent\n"
"implementations of memcached support authentication via SASL this\n"
"introduces a performance and complexity burden not warranted when\n"
"cached is dedicated to our exclusive use and access controlled by OS\n"
"mechanisms.\n"
"\n"
"Conventionally daemons are protected by assigning a system uid and/or\n"
"gid to the daemon. A daemon launched by root will drop it's privileges\n"
"by assuming the effective uid:gid assigned to it. File system access\n"
"is controlled by the OS via the effective identity and SELinux policy\n"
"can be crafted based on the identity. Thus the memcached UNIX socket\n"
"would be protected by having it owned by a specific system user and/or\n"
"membership in a restricted system group (discounting for the moment\n"
"SELinux).\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately we currently do not have an IPA system uid whose\n"
"identity our processes operate under nor do we have an IPA system\n"
"group. IPA does manage a collection of related processes (daemons) and\n"
"historically each has been assigned their own uid. When these\n"
"unrelated processes communicate they mutually authenticate via other\n"
"mechanisms. We do not have much of a history of using shared file\n"
"system objects across identities. When file objects are created they\n"
"are typically assigned the identity of daemon needing to access the\n"
"object and are not accessed by other daemons, or they carry root\n"
"identity.\n"
"\n"
"When our WSGI application runs in Apache it is run as a WSGI\n"
"daemon. This means when Apache starts up it forks off WSGI processes\n"
"for us and we are independent of other Apache processes. When WSGI is\n"
"run in this mode there is the ability to set the uid:gid of the WSGI\n"
"process hosting us, however we currently do not take advantage of this\n"
"option. WSGI can be run in other modes as well, only in daemon mode\n"
"can the uid:gid be independently set from the rest of Apache. All\n"
"processes started by Apache can be set to a common uid:gid specified\n"
"in the global Apache configuration, by default it's\n"
"apache:apache. Thus when our IPA code executes it is running as\n"
"apache:apache.\n"
"\n"
"To protect our memcached UNIX socket we can do one of two things:\n"
"\n"
"1. Assign it's uid:gid as apache:apache. This would limit access to\n"
"   our cache only to processes running under httpd. It's somewhat\n"
"   restricted but far from ideal. Any code running in the web server\n"
"   could potentially access our cache. It's difficult to control what the\n"
"   web server runs and admins may not understand the consequences of\n"
"   configuring httpd to serve other things besides IPA.\n"
"\n"
"2. Create an IPA specific uid:gid, for example ipa:ipa. We then configure\n"
"   our WSGI application to run as the ipa:ipa user and group. We also\n"
"   configure our memcached instance to run as the ipa:ipa user and\n"
"   group. In this configuration we are now fully protected, only our WSGI\n"
"   code can read & write to our memcached UNIX socket.\n"
"\n"
"However there may be unforeseen issues by converting our code to run as\n"
"something other than apache:apache. This would require some\n"
"investigation and testing.\n"
"\n"
"IPA is dependent on other system daemons, specifically Directory\n"
"Server (ds) and Certificate Server (cs). Currently we configure ds to\n"
"run under the dirsrv:dirsrv user and group, an identity of our\n"
"creation. We allow cs to default to it's pkiuser:pkiuser user and\n"
"group. Should these other cooperating daemons also run under the\n"
"common ipa:ipa user and group identities? At first blush there would\n"
"seem to be an advantage to coalescing all process identities under a\n"
"common IPA user and group identity. However these other processes do\n"
"not depend on user and group permissions when working with external\n"
"agents, processes, etc. Rather they are designed to be stand-alone\n"
"network services which authenticate their clients via other\n"
"mechanisms. They do depend on user and group permission to manage\n"
"their own file system objects. If somehow the ipa user and/or group\n"
"were compromised or malicious code somehow executed under the ipa\n"
"identity there would be an advantage in having the cooperating\n"
"processes cordoned off under their own identities providing one extra\n"
"layer of protection. (Note, these cooperating daemons may not even be\n"
"co-located on the same node in which case the issue is moot)\n"
"\n"
"The UNIX socket behavior (ldapi) with Directory Server is as follows:\n"
"\n"
"  * The socket ownership is: root:root\n"
"\n"
"  * The socket permissions are: 0666\n"
"\n"
"  * When connecting via ldapi you must authenticate as you would\n"
"    normally with a TCP socket, except ...\n"
"\n"
"  * If autobind is enabled and the uid:gid is available via\n"
"    SO_PEERCRED and the uid:gid can be found in the set of users known\n"
"    to the Directory Server then that connection will be bound as that\n"
"    user.\n"
"\n"
"  * Otherwise an anonymous bind will occur.\n"
"\n"
"memcached UNIX socket behavior is as follows:\n"
"\n"
"  * memcached can be invoked with a user argument, no group may be\n"
"    specified. The effective uid is the uid of the user argument and\n"
"    the effective gid is the primary group of the user, let's call\n"
"    this euid:egid\n"
"\n"
"  * The socket ownership is: euid:egid\n"
"\n"
"  * The socket permissions are 0700 by default, but this can be\n"
"    modified by the -a mask command line arg which sets the umask\n"
"    (defaults to 0700).\n"
"\n"
"Overview of authentication in IPA\n"
"=================================\n"
"\n"
"This describes how we currently authenticate and how we plan to\n"
"improve authentication performance. First some definitions.\n"
"\n"
"There are 4 major players:\n"
"\n"
"  1. client\n"
"  2. mod_auth_kerb (in Apache process)\n"
"  3. wsgi handler (in IPA wsgi python process)\n"
"  4. ds (directory server)\n"
"\n"
"There are several resources:\n"
"\n"
"  1. /ipa/ui (unprotected, web UI static resources)\n"
"  2. /ipa/xml (protected, xmlrpc RPC used by command line clients)\n"
"  3. /ipa/json (protected, json RPC used by javascript in web UI)\n"
"  4. ds (protected, wsgi acts as proxy, our LDAP server)\n"
"\n"
"Current Model\n"
"-------------\n"
"\n"
"This describes how things work in our current system for the web UI.\n"
"\n"
"  1. Client requests /ipa/ui, this is unprotected, is static and\n"
"     contains no sensitive information. Apache replies with html and\n"
"     javascript. The javascript requests /ipa/json.\n"
"\n"
"  2. Client sends post to /ipa/json.\n"
"\n"
"  3. mod_auth_kerb is configured to protect /ipa/json, replies 401\n"
"     authenticate negotiate.\n"
"\n"
"  4. Client resends with credentials\n"
"\n"
"  5. mod_auth_kerb validates credentials\n"
"\n"
"     a. if invalid replies 403 access denied (stops here)\n"
"\n"
"     b. if valid creates temporary ccache, adds KRB5CCNAME to request\n"
"        headers\n"
"\n"
"  6. Request passed to wsgi handler\n"
"\n"
"     a. validates request, KRB5CCNAME must be present, referrer, etc.\n"
"\n"
"     b. ccache saved and used to bind to ds\n"
"\n"
"     c. routes to specified RPC handler.\n"
"\n"
"  7. wsgi handler replies to client\n"
"\n"
"Proposed new session based optimization\n"
"---------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"The round trip negotiate and credential validation in steps 3,4,5 is\n"
"expensive. This can be avoided if we can cache the client\n"
"credentials. With client sessions we can store the client credentials\n"
"in the session bound to the client.\n"
"\n"
"A few notes about the session implementation.\n"
"\n"
"  * based on session cookies, cookies must be enabled\n"
"\n"
"  * session cookie is secure, only passed on secure connections, only\n"
"    passed to our URL resource, never visible to client javascript\n"
"    etc.\n"
"\n"
"  * session cookie has a session id which is used by wsgi handler to\n"
"    retrieve client session data from shared multi-process cache.\n"
"\n"
"Changes to Apache's resource protection\n"
"---------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"  * /ipa/json is no longer protected by mod_auth_kerb. This is\n"
"    necessary to avoid the negotiate expense in steps 3,4,5\n"
"    above. Instead the /ipa/json resource will be protected in our wsgi\n"
"    handler via the session cookie.\n"
"\n"
"  * A new protected URI is introduced, /ipa/login. This resource\n"
"    does no serve any data, it is used exclusively for authentication.\n"
"\n"
"The new sequence is:\n"
"\n"
"  1. Client requests /ipa/ui, this is unprotected. Apache replies with\n"
"     html and javascript. The javascript requests /ipa/json.\n"
"\n"
"  2. Client sends post to /ipa/json, which is unprotected.\n"
"\n"
"  3. wsgi handler obtains session data from session cookie.\n"
"\n"
"     a. if ccache is present in session data and is valid\n"
"\n"
"        - request is further validated\n"
"\n"
"        - ccache is established for bind to ds\n"
"\n"
"        - request is routed to RPC handler\n"
"\n"
"        - wsgi handler eventually replies to client\n"
"\n"
"     b. if ccache is not present or not valid processing continues ...\n"
"\n"
"  4. wsgi handler replies with 401 Unauthorized\n"
"\n"
"  5. client sends request to /ipa/login to obtain session credentials\n"
"\n"
"  6. mod_auth_kerb replies 401 negotiate on /ipa/login\n"
"\n"
"  7. client sends credentials to /ipa/login\n"
"\n"
"  8. mod_auth_kerb validates credentials\n"
"\n"
"     a. if valid\n"
"\n"
"        - mod_auth_kerb permits access to /ipa/login. wsgi handler is\n"
"          invoked and does the following:\n"
"\n"
"          * establishes session for client\n"
"\n"
"          * retrieves the ccache from KRB5CCNAME and stores it\n"
"\n"
"     a. if invalid\n"
"\n"
"        - mod_auth_kerb sends 403 access denied (processing stops)\n"
"\n"
"  9. client now posts the same data again to /ipa/json including\n"
"     session cookie. Processing repeats starting at step 2 and since\n"
"     the session data now contains a valid ccache step 3a executes, a\n"
"     successful reply is sent to client.\n"

"Manage trust relationship between IPA and Active Directory domains.\n"
"\n"
"In order to allow users from a remote domain to access resources in IPA\n"
"domain, trust relationship needs to be established. Currently IPA supports\n"
"only trusts between IPA and Active Directory domains under control of "
"Windows\n"
"Server 2008 or later, with functional level 2008 or later.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that DNS on both IPA and Active Directory domain sides should "
"be\n"
"configured properly to discover each other. Trust relationship relies on\n"
"ability to discover special resources in the other domain via DNS records.\n"
"\n"
"Examples:\n"
"\n"
"1. Establish cross-realm trust with Active Directory using AD administrator\n"
"   credentials:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa trust-add --type=ad <ad.domain> --admin <AD domain administrator> --"
"password\n"
"\n"
"2. List all existing trust relationships:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa trust-find\n"
"\n"
"3. Show details of the specific trust relationship:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa trust-show <ad.domain>\n"
"\n"
"4. Delete existing trust relationship:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa trust-del <ad.domain>\n"
"\n"
"Once trust relationship is established, remote users will need to be mapped\n"
"to local POSIX groups in order to actually use IPA resources. The mapping "
"should\n"
"be done via use of external membership of non-POSIX group and then this "
"group\n"
"should be included into one of local POSIX groups.\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"1. Create group for the trusted domain admins' mapping and their local POSIX "
"group:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa group-add --desc='<ad.domain> admins external map' ad_admins_external "
"--external\n"
"   ipa group-add --desc='<ad.domain> admins' ad_admins\n"
"\n"
"2. Add security identifier of Domain Admins of the <ad.domain> to the "
"ad_admins_external\n"
"   group:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa group-add-member ad_admins_external --external 'AD\\Domain Admins'\n"
"\n"
"3. Allow members of ad_admins_external group to be associated with ad_admins "
"POSIX group:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa group-add-member ad_admins --groups ad_admins_external\n"
"\n"
"4. List members of external members of ad_admins_external group to see their "
"SIDs:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa group-show ad_admins_external\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"GLOBAL TRUST CONFIGURATION\n"
"\n"
"When IPA AD trust subpackage is installed and ipa-adtrust-install is run,\n"
"a local domain configuration (SID, GUID, NetBIOS name) is generated. These\n"
"identifiers are then used when communicating with a trusted domain of the\n"
"particular type.\n"
"\n"
"1. Show global trust configuration for Active Directory type of trusts:\n"
"\n"
"   ipa trustconfig-show --type ad\n"
"\n"
"2. Modify global configuration for all trusts of Active Directory type and "
"set\n"
"   a different fallback primary group (fallback primary group GID is used "

"internally to assign SIDs to IPA users and groups. The SID will then be "
"stored\n"
"in the user or group objects.\n"
"\n"
"If e.g. the ID range for the local domain is configured with the values "
"from\n"
"the example above then a new user with the UID 1200007 will get the RID "
"1007.\n"
"If this RID is already used by a group the RID will be 1000007. This can "
"only\n"
"happen if a user or a group object was created with a fixed ID because the\n"
"automatic assignment will not assign the same ID twice. Since there are "
"only\n"
"users and groups sharing the same ID namespace it is sufficient to have "
"only\n"
"one fallback range to handle conflicts.\n"
"\n"
"To find the Posix ID for a given RID from the local domain it has to be\n"
"checked first if the RID falls in the primary or secondary RID range and\n"
"the rid-base or the secondary-rid-base has to be subtracted, respectively,\n"
"and the base-id has to be added to get the Posix ID.\n"
"\n"
"Typically the creation of ID ranges happens behind the scenes and this CLI\n"
"must not be used at all. The ID range for the local domain will be created\n"
"during installation or upgrade from an older version. The ID range for a\n"
"trusted domain will be created together with the trust by 'ipa trust-"
"add ...'.\n"
"\n"
"USE CASES:\n"
"\n"
"  Add an ID range from a transitively trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the trusted domain (A) trusts another domain (B) as well and this "
"trust\n"
"    is transitive 'ipa trust-add domain-A' will only create a range for\n"
"    domain A.  The ID range for domain B must be added manually.\n"
"\n"
"  Add an additional ID range for the local domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the ID range of the local domain is exhausted, i.e. no new IDs can "
"be\n"
"    assigned to Posix users or groups by the DNA plugin, a new range has to "
"be\n"
"    created to allow new users and groups to be added. (Currently there is "
"no\n"
"    connection between this range CLI and the DNA plugin, but a future "
"version\n"
"    might be able to modify the configuration of the DNS plugin as well)\n"
"\n"
"In general it is not necessary to modify or delete ID ranges. If there is "
"no\n"
"other way to achieve a certain configuration than to modify or delete an ID\n"
"range it should be done with great care. Because UIDs are stored in the "
"file\n"
"system and are used for access control it might be possible that users are\n"
"allowed to access files of other users if an ID range got deleted and "
"reused\n"
"for a different domain.\n"
"\n"
"(*) The RID is typically the last integer of a user or group SID which "
"follows\n"
"the domain SID. E.g. if the domain SID is S-1-5-21-123-456-789 and a user "
"from\n"
"this domain has the SID S-1-5-21-123-456-789-1010 then 1010 id the RID of "

"Directory Server Access Control Instructions (ACIs)\n"
"\n"
"ACIs are used to allow or deny access to information. This module is\n"
"currently designed to allow, not deny, access.\n"
"\n"
"The aci commands are designed to grant permissions that allow updating\n"
"existing entries or adding or deleting new ones. The goal of the ACIs\n"
"that ship with IPA is to provide a set of low-level permissions that\n"
"grant access to special groups called taskgroups. These low-level\n"
"permissions can be combined into roles that grant broader access. These\n"
"roles are another type of group, roles.\n"
"\n"
"For example, if you have taskgroups that allow adding and modifying users "
"you\n"
"could create a role, useradmin. You would assign users to the useradmin\n"
"role to allow them to do the operations defined by the taskgroups.\n"
"\n"
"You can create ACIs that delegate permission so users in group A can write\n"
"attributes on group B.\n"
"\n"
"The type option is a map that applies to all entries in the users, groups "
"or\n"
"host location. It is primarily designed to be used when granting add\n"
"permissions (to write new entries).\n"
"\n"
"An ACI consists of three parts:\n"
"1. target\n"
"2. permissions\n"
"3. bind rules\n"
"\n"
"The target is a set of rules that define which LDAP objects are being\n"
"targeted. This can include a list of attributes, an area of that LDAP\n"
"tree or an LDAP filter.\n"
"\n"
"The targets include:\n"
"- attrs: list of attributes affected\n"
"- type: an object type (user, group, host, service, etc)\n"
"- memberof: members of a group\n"
"- targetgroup: grant access to modify a specific group. This is primarily\n"
"  designed to enable users to add or remove members of a specific group.\n"
"- filter: A legal LDAP filter used to narrow the scope of the target.\n"
"- subtree: Used to apply a rule across an entire set of objects. For "
"example,\n"
"  to allow adding users you need to grant \"add\" permission to the subtree\n"
"  ldap://uid=*,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com. The subtree option\n"
"  is a fail-safe for objects that may not be covered by the type option.\n"
"\n"
"The permissions define what the ACI is allowed to do, and are one or\n"
"more of:\n"
"1. write - write one or more attributes\n"
"2. read - read one or more attributes\n"
"3. add - add a new entry to the tree\n"
"4. delete - delete an existing entry\n"
"5. all - all permissions are granted\n"
"\n"
"Note the distinction between attributes and entries. The permissions are\n"
"independent, so being able to add a user does not mean that the user will\n"
"be editable.\n"
"\n"
"The bind rule defines who this ACI grants permissions to. The LDAP server\n"
"allows this to be any valid LDAP entry but we encourage the use of\n"
"taskgroups so that the rights can be easily shared through roles.\n"
"\n"
"For a more thorough description of access controls see\n"
"http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/ag/8.0/Managing_Access_Control."
"html\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: ACIs are now added via the permission plugin. These examples are to\n"
"demonstrate how the various options work but this is done via the "
"permission\n"
"command-line now (see last example).\n"
"\n"

"USING STRUCTURED PER-TYPE OPTIONS\n"
"\n"
"There are many structured DNS RR types where DNS data stored in LDAP server\n"
"is not just a scalar value, for example an IP address or a domain name, but\n"
"a data structure which may be often complex. A good example is a LOC record\n"
"[RFC1876] which consists of many mandatory and optional parts (degrees,\n"
"minutes, seconds of latitude and longitude, altitude or precision).\n"
"\n"
"It may be difficult to manipulate such DNS records without making a mistake\n"
"and entering an invalid value. DNS module provides an abstraction over "
"these\n"
"raw records and allows to manipulate each RR type with specific options. "
"For\n"
"each supported RR type, DNS module provides a standard option to manipulate\n"
"a raw records with format --<rrtype>-rec, e.g. --mx-rec, and special "
"options\n"
"for every part of the RR structure with format --<rrtype>-<partname>, e.g.\n"
"--mx-preference and --mx-exchanger.\n"
"\n"
"When adding a record, either RR specific options or standard option for a "
"raw\n"
"value can be used, they just should not be combined in one add operation. "
"When\n"
"modifying an existing entry, new RR specific options can be used to change\n"
"one part of a DNS record, where the standard option for raw value is used\n"
"to specify the modified value. The following example demonstrates\n"
"a modification of MX record preference from 0 to 1 in a record without\n"
"modifying the exchanger:\n"
"ipa dnsrecord-mod --mx-rec=\"0 mx.example.com.\" --mx-preference=1\n"

"In general it is not necessary to modify or delete ID ranges. If there is "

"A permission enables fine-grained delegation of rights. A permission is\n"

"A permission grants the right to perform a specific task such as adding a\n"
"user, modifying a group, etc.\n"
"\n"
"A permission may not contain other permissions.\n"
"\n"
"* A permission grants access to read, write, add or delete.\n"
"* A privilege combines similar permissions (for example all the permissions\n"
"  needed to add a user).\n"
"* A role grants a set of privileges to users, groups, hosts or hostgroups.\n"
"\n"
"A permission is made up of a number of different parts:\n"
"\n"
"1. The name of the permission.\n"
"2. The target of the permission.\n"
"3. The rights granted by the permission.\n"
"\n"
"Rights define what operations are allowed, and may be one or more\n"
"of the following:\n"
"1. write - write one or more attributes\n"
"2. read - read one or more attributes\n"
"3. add - add a new entry to the tree\n"
"4. delete - delete an existing entry\n"
"5. all - all permissions are granted\n"
"\n"
"Read permission is granted for most attributes by default so the read\n"
"permission is not expected to be used very often.\n"
"\n"
"Note the distinction between attributes and entries. The permissions are\n"
"independent, so being able to add a user does not mean that the user will\n"
"be editable.\n"
"\n"
"There are a number of allowed targets:\n"
"1. type: a type of object (user, group, etc).\n"
"2. memberof: a member of a group or hostgroup\n"
"3. filter: an LDAP filter\n"
"4. subtree: an LDAP filter specifying part of the LDAP DIT. This is a\n"

"Manage CA ACL rules.\n"
"\n"
"This plugin is used to define rules governing which CAs and profiles\n"
"may be used to issue certificates to particular principals or groups\n"
"of principals.\n"
"\n"
"SUBJECT PRINCIPAL SCOPE:\n"
"\n"
"For a certificate request to be allowed, the principal(s) that are\n"
"the subject of a certificate request (not necessarily the principal\n"
"actually requesting the certificate) must be included in the scope\n"
"of a CA ACL that also includes the target CA and profile.\n"
"\n"
"Users can be included by name, group or the \"all users\" category.\n"
"Hosts can be included by name, hostgroup or the \"all hosts\"\n"
"category.  Services can be included by service name or the \"all\n"
"services\" category.  CA ACLs may be associated with a single type of\n"
"principal, or multiple types.\n"
"\n"
"CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY SCOPE:\n"
"\n"
"A CA ACL can be associated with one or more CAs by name, or by the\n"
"\"all CAs\" category.  For compatibility reasons, a CA ACL with no CA\n"
"association implies an association with the 'ipa' CA (and only this\n"
"CA).\n"
"\n"
"PROFILE SCOPE:\n"
"\n"
"A CA ACL can be associated with one or more profiles by Profile ID.\n"
"The Profile ID is a string without spaces or punctuation starting\n"
"with a letter and followed by a sequence of letters, digits or\n"
"underscore (\"_\").\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
"  Create a CA ACL \"test\" that grants all users access to the\n"
"  \"UserCert\" profile on all CAs:\n"
"    ipa caacl-add test --usercat=all --cacat=all\n"
"    ipa caacl-add-profile test --certprofiles UserCert\n"
"\n"
"  Display the properties of a named CA ACL:\n"
"    ipa caacl-show test\n"
"\n"
"  Create a CA ACL to let user \"alice\" use the \"DNP3\" profile on \"DNP3-CA"

"ID ranges\n"
"\n"
"Manage ID ranges  used to map Posix IDs to SIDs and back.\n"
"\n"
"There are two type of ID ranges which are both handled by this utility:\n"
"\n"
" - the ID ranges of the local domain\n"
" - the ID ranges of trusted remote domains\n"
"\n"
"Both types have the following attributes in common:\n"
"\n"
" - base-id: the first ID of the Posix ID range\n"
" - range-size: the size of the range\n"
"\n"
"With those two attributes a range object can reserve the Posix IDs starting\n"
"with base-id up to but not including base-id+range-size exclusively.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally an ID range of the local domain may set\n"
" - rid-base: the first RID(*) of the corresponding RID range\n"
" - secondary-rid-base: first RID of the secondary RID range\n"
"\n"
"and an ID range of a trusted domain must set\n"
" - rid-base: the first RID of the corresponding RID range\n"
" - sid: domain SID of the trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: Add a new ID range for a trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"Since there might be more than one trusted domain the domain SID must be "
"given\n"
"while creating the ID range.\n"
"\n"
"  ipa idrange-add --base-id=1200000 --range-size=200000 --rid-base=0 \\\n"
"                  --dom-sid=S-1-5-21-123-456-789 trusted_dom_range\n"
"\n"
"This ID range is then used by the IPA server and the SSSD IPA provider to\n"
"assign Posix UIDs to users from the trusted domain.\n"
"\n"
"If e.g a range for a trusted domain is configured with the following "
"values:\n"
" base-id = 1200000\n"
" range-size = 200000\n"
" rid-base = 0\n"
"the RIDs 0 to 199999 are mapped to the Posix ID from 1200000 to 13999999. "
"So\n"
"RID 1000 <-> Posix ID 1201000\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: Add a new ID range for the local domain\n"
"\n"
"To create an ID range for the local domain it is not necessary to specify a\n"
"domain SID. But since it is possible that a user and a group can have the "
"same\n"
"value as Posix ID a second RID interval is needed to handle conflicts.\n"
"\n"
"  ipa idrange-add --base-id=1200000 --range-size=200000 --rid-base=1000 \\\n"
"                  --secondary-rid-base=1000000 local_range\n"
"\n"
"The data from the ID ranges of the local domain are used by the IPA server\n"
"internally to assign SIDs to IPA users and groups. The SID will then be "
"stored\n"
"in the user or group objects.\n"
"\n"
"If e.g. the ID range for the local domain is configured with the values "
"from\n"
"the example above then a new user with the UID 1200007 will get the RID "
"1007.\n"
"If this RID is already used by a group the RID will be 1000007. This can "
"only\n"
"happen if a user or a group object was created with a fixed ID because the\n"
"automatic assignment will not assign the same ID twice. Since there are "
"only\n"
"users and groups sharing the same ID namespace it is sufficient to have "
"only\n"
"one fallback range to handle conflicts.\n"
"\n"
"To find the Posix ID for a given RID from the local domain it has to be\n"
"checked first if the RID falls in the primary or secondary RID range and\n"
"the rid-base or the secondary-rid-base has to be subtracted, respectively,\n"
"and the base-id has to be added to get the Posix ID.\n"
"\n"
"Typically the creation of ID ranges happens behind the scenes and this CLI\n"
"must not be used at all. The ID range for the local domain will be created\n"
"during installation or upgrade from an older version. The ID range for a\n"
"trusted domain will be created together with the trust by 'ipa trust-"
"add ...'.\n"
"\n"
"USE CASES:\n"
"\n"
"  Add an ID range from a transitively trusted domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the trusted domain (A) trusts another domain (B) as well and this "
"trust\n"
"    is transitive 'ipa trust-add domain-A' will only create a range for\n"
"    domain A.  The ID range for domain B must be added manually.\n"
"\n"
"  Add an additional ID range for the local domain\n"
"\n"
"    If the ID range of the local domain is exhausted, i.e. no new IDs can "
"be\n"
"    assigned to Posix users or groups by the DNA plugin, a new range has to "
"be\n"
"    created to allow new users and groups to be added. (Currently there is "
"no\n"
"    connection between this range CLI and the DNA plugin, but a future "
"version\n"
"    might be able to modify the configuration of the DNS plugin as well)\n"
"\n"
"In general it is not necessary to modify or delete ID ranges. If there is "
"no\n"
"other way to achieve a certain configuration than to modify or delete an ID\n"
"range it should be done with great care. Because UIDs are stored in the "
"file\n"
"system and are used for access control it might be possible that users are\n"
"allowed to access files of other users if an ID range got deleted and "
"reused\n"
"for a different domain.\n"
"\n"
"(*) The RID is typically the last integer of a user or group SID which "
"follows\n"
"the domain SID. E.g. if the domain SID is S-1-5-21-123-456-789 and a user "

"Migration to IPA\n"
"\n"
"Migrate users and groups from an LDAP server to IPA.\n"
"\n"
"This performs an LDAP query against the remote server searching for\n"
"users and groups in a container. In order to migrate passwords you need\n"
"to bind as a user that can read the userPassword attribute on the remote\n"
"server. This is generally restricted to high-level admins such as\n"
"cn=Directory Manager in 389-ds (this is the default bind user).\n"
"\n"
"The default user container is ou=People.\n"
"\n"
"The default group container is ou=Groups.\n"
"\n"
"Users and groups that already exist on the IPA server are skipped.\n"
"\n"
"Two LDAP schemas define how group members are stored: RFC2307 and\n"
"RFC2307bis. RFC2307bis uses member and uniquemember to specify group\n"
"members, RFC2307 uses memberUid. The default schema is RFC2307bis.\n"
"\n"
"The schema compat feature allows IPA to reformat data for systems that\n"
"do not support RFC2307bis. It is recommended that this feature is disabled\n"
"during migration to reduce system overhead. It can be re-enabled after\n"
"migration. To migrate with it enabled use the \"--with-compat\" option.\n"
"\n"
"Migrated users do not have Kerberos credentials, they have only their\n"
"LDAP password. To complete the migration process, users need to go\n"
"to http://ipa.example.com/ipa/migration and authenticate using their\n"
"LDAP password in order to generate their Kerberos credentials.\n"
"\n"
"Migration is disabled by default. Use the command ipa config-mod to\n"
"enable it:\n"
"\n"
" ipa config-mod --enable-migration=TRUE\n"
"\n"
"If a base DN is not provided with --basedn then IPA will use either\n"
"the value of defaultNamingContext if it is set or the first value\n"
"in namingContexts set in the root of the remote LDAP server.\n"
"\n"
"Users are added as members to the default user group. This can be a\n"
"time-intensive task so during migration this is done in a batch\n"
"mode for every 100 users. As a result there will be a window in which\n"
"users will be added to IPA but will not be members of the default\n"
"user group.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
" The simplest migration, accepting all defaults:\n"
"   ipa migrate-ds ldap://ds.example.com:389\n"
"\n"
" Specify the user and group container. This can be used to migrate user\n"
" and group data from an IPA v1 server:\n"
"   ipa migrate-ds --user-container='cn=users,cn=accounts' \\\n"
"       --group-container='cn=groups,cn=accounts' \\\n"
"       ldap://ds.example.com:389\n"
"\n"
" Since IPA v2 server already contain predefined groups that may collide "

"Services\n"
"\n"
"A IPA service represents a service that runs on a host. The IPA service\n"
"record can store a Kerberos principal, an SSL certificate, or both.\n"
"\n"
"An IPA service can be managed directly from a machine, provided that\n"
"machine has been given the correct permission. This is true even for\n"
"machines other than the one the service is associated with. For example,\n"
"requesting an SSL certificate using the host service principal credentials\n"
"of the host. To manage a service using host credentials you need to\n"
"kinit as the host:\n"
"\n"
" # kinit -kt /etc/krb5.keytab host/ipa.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\n"
"\n"
"Adding an IPA service allows the associated service to request an SSL\n"
"certificate or keytab, but this is performed as a separate step; they\n"
"are not produced as a result of adding the service.\n"
"\n"
"Only the public aspect of a certificate is stored in a service record;\n"
"the private key is not stored.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
" Add a new IPA service:\n"
"   ipa service-add HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"\n"
" Allow a host to manage an IPA service certificate:\n"
"   ipa service-add-host --hosts=web.example.com HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"   ipa role-add-member --hosts=web.example.com certadmin\n"
"\n"
" Override a default list of supported PAC types for the service:\n"
"   ipa service-mod HTTP/web.example.com --pac-type=MS-PAC\n"
"\n"
"   A typical use case where overriding the PAC type is needed is NFS.\n"
"   Currently the related code in the Linux kernel can only handle Kerberos\n"
"   tickets up to a maximal size. Since the PAC data can become quite large "
"it\n"
"   is recommended to set --pac-type=NONE for NFS services.\n"
"\n"
" Delete an IPA service:\n"
"   ipa service-del HTTP/web.example.com\n"
"\n"
" Find all IPA services associated with a host:\n"
"   ipa service-find web.example.com\n"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configures a new IPA server that is a replica of the server. Once it has been created it is an exact copy of the original IPA server and is an equal master. Changes made to any master are automatically replicated to other masters.

To create a replica in a domain at domain level 0, you need to provide an replica file. The replica_file is created using the ipa\-replica\-prepare utility.

To create a replica in a domain at domain level 1, you don't have to provide a replica file, the machine only needs to be enrolled in the FreeIPA domain first. This process of turning the IPA client into a replica is also referred to as replica promotion.

If you're starting with an existing IPA client, simply run ipa\-replica\-install to have it promoted into a replica.

To promote a blank machine into a replica, you have two options, you can either run ipa\-client\-install in a separate step, or pass the enrollment related options to the ipa\-replica\-install (see DOMAIN LEVEL 1 CLIENT ENROLLMENT OPTIONS). In the latter case, ipa\-replica\-install will join the machine to the IPA realm automatically and will proceed with the promotion step.

If the installation fails you may need to run ipa\-server\-install \-\-uninstall and ipa\-client\-install before running ipa\-replica\-install again.

The installation will fail if the host you are installing the replica on exists as a host in IPA or an existing replication agreement exists (for example, from a previously failed installation).

A replica should only be installed on the same or higher version of IPA on the remote system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "DOMAIN LEVEL 1 OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-principal\fR

.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-admin\-password\fR
The Kerberos password for the given principal.

.SS "DOMAIN LEVEL 1 CLIENT ENROLLMENT OPTIONS"
To install client and promote it to replica using a host keytab or One Time Password, the host needs to be a member of ipaservers group. This requires to create a host entry and add it to the host group prior replica installation.

\-\-server, \-\-domain, \-\-realm  options are autodiscovered via DNS records by default. See manual page
.BR ipa\-client\-install (1)
for further details about these options.

.SS "BASIC OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-ip\-address\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
The IP address of this server. If this address does not match the address the host resolves to and \-\-setup\-dns is not selected the installation will fail. If the server hostname is not resolvable, a record for the hostname and IP_ADDRESS is added to /etc/hosts.
This this option can be used multiple times to specify more IP addresses of the server (e.g. multihomed and/or dualstacked server).

Configure  an integrated DNS server, create a primary DNS zone (name specified by \-\-domain or taken from an existing deployment), and fill it with service records necessary for IPA deployment.
In cases where the IPA server name does not belong to the primary DNS domain and is not resolvable using DNS, create a DNS zone containing the IPA server name as well.

This option requires that you either specify at least one DNS forwarder through
the \fB\-\-forwarder\fR option or use the \fB\-\-no\-forwarders\fR option.

Note that you can set up a DNS at any time after the initial IPA server install by running
.B ipa-dns-install
(see
.BR ipa-dns-install (1)).
IPA DNS cannot be uninstalled.
.TP
\fB\-\-forwarder\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR

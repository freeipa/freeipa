ipa\-replica\-install \- Create an IPA replica
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-replica\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]... replica_file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configures a new IPA server that is a replica of the server that generated it. Once it has been created it is an exact copy of the original IPA server and is an equal master. Changes made to any master are automatically replicated to other masters.

The replica_file is created using the ipa\-replica\-prepare utility.

ipa\-server\-install \- Configure an IPA server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-server\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configures the services needed by an IPA server. This includes setting up a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) with an LDAP back\-end, configuring Apache, configuring NTP and starting some IPA\-provided services: ipa_kpasswd and ipa_webgui. By default a dogtag-based CA will be configured to issue server certificates.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-domain\fR=\fIDOMAIN_NAME\fR
Your DNS domain name
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-ds\-password\fR=\fIDM_PASSWORD\fR

.SH "NAME"
ipa\-server\-install \- Configure an IPA server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-server\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configures the services needed by an IPA server. This includes setting up a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) with an LDAP back\-end, configuring Apache, configuring NTP and starting the ipa_kpasswd service provided by IPA. By default a dogtag\-based CA will be configured to issue server certificates.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIREALM_NAME\fR, \fB\-\-realm\fR=\fIREALM_NAME\fR
The Kerberos realm name for the IPA server
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fIDOMAIN_NAME\fR, \fB\-\-domain\fR=\fIDOMAIN_NAME\fR
Your DNS domain name
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIDM_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-ds\-password\fR=\fIDM_PASSWORD\fR
The password to be used by the Directory Server for the Directory Manager user
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fIMASTER_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-master\-password\fR=\fIMASTER_PASSWORD\fR
The kerberos master password (normally autogenerated)
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fIADMIN_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-admin\-password\fR=\fIADMIN_PASSWORD\fR
The password for the IPA admin user
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Enable debug logging when more verbose output is needed
.TP
\fB\-\-selfsign\fR
Configure a self\-signed CA instance for issuing server certificates instead of using dogtag for certificates
.TP
\fB\-\-external\-ca\fR
Generate a CSR to be signed by an external CA
.TP
\fB\-\-external_cert_file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
File containing PKCS#10 certificate
.TP
\fB\-\-external_ca_file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
File containing PKCS#10 of the external CA chain
.TP
\fB\-\-hostname\fR=\fIHOST_NAME\fR
The fully\-qualified DNS name of this server
.TP
\fB\-\-ip\-address\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
The IP address of this server. If this address does not match the address the host resolves to and --setup-dns is not selected the installation will fail.
.TP
\fB\-\-setup\-dns\fR
Generate a DNS zone if it does not exist already and configure the DNS server.
This option requires that you either specify at least one DNS forwarder through
the \fB\-\-forwarder\fR option or use the \fB\-\-no\-forwarders\fR option.

Note that you can set up a DNS at any time after the initial IPA server install by running
.B ipa-dns-install
(see
.BR ipa-dns-install (1)).
.TP
\fB\-\-forwarder\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
Add a DNS forwarder to the DNS configuration. You can use this option multiple
times to specify more forwarders, but at least one must be provided, unless
the \fB\-\-no\-forwarders\fR option is specified.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-forwarders\fR
Do not add any DNS forwarders. Root DNS servers will be used instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-reverse\-zone\fR=\fIREVERSE_ZONE\fR
The reverse DNS zone to use
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-reverse\fR
Do not create reverse DNS zone
.TP
\fB\-\-zonemgr\fR
The e\-mail address of the DNS zone manager. Defaults to root@host.domain
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unattended\fR
An unattended installation that will never prompt for user input
.TP
\fB\-\-uninstall\fR
Uninstall an existing IPA installation
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-no\-ntp\fR
Do not configure NTP
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-pkinit\fR
Disables pkinit setup steps
.TP

.TP
\fB\-\-http_pkcs12\fR=\fIFILE\fR
PKCS#12 file containing the Apache Server SSL Certificate
.TP
\fB\-\-pkinit_pkcs12\fR=\fIFILE\fR
PKCS#12 file containing the Kerberos KDC SSL certificate
.TP
\fB\-\-dirsrv_pin\fR=\fIDIRSRV_PIN\fR
The password of the Directory Server PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-http_pin\fR=\fIHTTP_PIN\fR
The password of the Apache Server PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-pkinit_pin\fR=\fIPKINIT_PIN\fR
The password of the Kerberos KDC PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-host\-dns\fR
Do not use DNS for hostname lookup during installation
.TP
\fB\-\-idstart\fR=\fIIDSTART\fR
The starting user and group id number (default random)
.TP
\fB\-\-idmax\fR=\fIIDMAX\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-subject\fR=\fISUBJECT\fR
 The certificate subject base (default O=REALM.NAME)
.TP
\fB\-\-no_hbac_allow\fR
